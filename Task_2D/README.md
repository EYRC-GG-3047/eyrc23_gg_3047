# 2 csv files, one which contains the coordinates to traverse, and one where the coordinates (latitude and longitude) are updated on a regular interval for the model to traverse
# a python file that takes in the coordinates from the csv file and updates the values in the other, while returning success or failure of path traversal
# and output png file which contains the successful output of the model
