Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is advised to be as elaborate as possible.

1.	A model was constructed using OpenCV (cv2) for object detection in images.
2.	Fixed-size 56x56 pixel boxes were employed for the object detection task.
3.	The image was divided into a grid of boxes with identical sizes.
4.	For each box, the placement of its top-left corner within the image was determined.
5.	The content within each box was accessed.
6.	The content was passed to a previously built image classification model.
7.	Class labels were provided by this model to identify the content within each box.
8.	The class labels for all 5 detected objects in the image were collected.
9.	The outcome consisted of the class labels that were gathered.
10.	The final procedure was taken to incorporate the model into the boilerplate code provided to us by eYantra website.
11.	The model was finally completed, with sometimes minute changes to make the model better.
